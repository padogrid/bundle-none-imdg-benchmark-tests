# Note that the required product versions listed in the file override the product
# versions that make up the bundle name.

# can be run on all versions of Geode 1.x.x, then specify 1 only. If it applies to
# 1.1.x, then 1.1. If the bundle applies to multiple specific versions, then list them
# comma-separated. For example, the following applies to Geode 1.12.2 and 1.13.x

# If the bunndle does not require a product, then set none=1.
